# Part 1: Setup & Context Engineering

[← Overview](00-overview.md)

---

In this section, you'll set up your development environment and teach GitHub Copilot about your codebase.

## 🔧 Initial Setup

### Step 1: Create Your Repository

Open [github.com/copilot-dev-days/agent-lab-typescript](https://github.com/copilot-dev-days/agent-lab-typescript), click **Use this template** → **Create a new repository**, and name it `my-bingo-mixer`.

Use **Public** visibility if you want to publish the app with GitHub Pages.

✅ Your own Bingo Mixer repo is ready!

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages (Optional)

Enable Pages if you want to test and share your app live:

1. Go to your repo's **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Under "Build and deployment", change *Deploy from a branch* to **GitHub Actions**
3. ✅ Pushes to `main` will publish to: `https://{username}.github.io/{repo-name}`

### Step 3: Choose How You'll Develop

#### Option A (Preferred): Clone locally in VS Code

1. Open VS Code
2. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS)
3. Run **Git: Clone** → **Clone from GitHub**
4. Select your new repository and choose a local folder
5. Open the cloned repository when prompted
6. Install recommended extensions (notification or `Extensions: Show Recommended Extensions`)

#### Option B: Create a Codespace for your repo

1. Open your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Code** → **Codespaces** → **Create codespace on main**
3. ✅ Codespace starts with your repo and devcontainer.

### Step 4: Review Trust and Approvals

Before setup becomes autonomous:

1. In Chat, select the **Local** session target and **Default Approvals**. Do not use **Bypass Approvals**, which approves every tool call.
2. Open `.vscode/settings.json` and review the terminal allowlist. The workspace adds auto-approval only for its exact `npm run dev`, `lint`, `build`, and `test` scripts plus `npm test`; installation, `npx`, script arguments, and unrelated commands still require review.
3. Apply least privilege: inspect each requested command and approve only the exact command for the shortest useful scope.

> A Git worktree can give parallel agent sessions separate checked-out files so their edits do not collide, but it does not restrict commands, network access, or access outside that working copy. Some Agent Host worktree sessions are fixed to Bypass Approvals, so use a regular Local folder session for this exercise. Learn more in [Approvals](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/agents/run/approvals).

### Step 5: Run the Setup Skill

In the Chat panel:

```
/setup
```

When the skill proposes `npm install`, inspect it and approve that exact command once. Let the agent determine the remaining installation steps without broadening approvals.

✅ **Success:** App is running and open in browser!

## 📚 Understanding Context Engineering

Context engineering is how you teach AI about your specific codebase. This makes Copilot's suggestions more accurate and relevant.

### Task 1: Auto-generated Instructions

Instructions guide all agentic codebase interactions, making them more efficient and reliable. Add them early, but make sure to keep them maintained and succinct.

**Steps:**

1. Run prompt: `/init` with Autopilot enabled
   - Based on the repo's existing conventions, `/init` may generate or update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` or a root `AGENTS.md`.
   - While agent analyzes the codebase, optionally start next task
2. Open a new chat for the next task, as init can take a while and we can review later.
3. Review results — is it not too long and overly detailed
   1. Optional follow-up: *"Compress down and add a mandatory development [ ] checklist (lint, build, test) to the top"*
4. Apply and commit

> A root-level `AGENTS.md` is a portable option when several AI coding tools share the repo. Use one root file here; nested `AGENTS.md` behavior is experimental and outside this lab.

✅ **Result:** All future requests will have a basic map of the workspace.

---

### Task 2: Dogfooding & Custom Skills

**Steps:**

1. Prompt: *"Test the app like a critical dogfooder, giving critical feedback on how fun it is"*
2. Watch how the agent launches the built-in browser, interacts with the app, and writes a report
3. `/create-skill` *for dogfooding* — or: *"Save this as a dogfooding skill"*

✅ **Result:** The agent used the browser to actually play the app and produced a critical report. You then saved that testing approach as a reusable dogfooding skill.

> 💡 **Context engineering insight:** The agent needs hands-on context — running the app, seeing the UI, clicking through flows — to truly understand how it works and validate functionality. Code alone isn't enough; interacting with the running product closes the gap between reading code and understanding the user experience.

---

### Task 3: Customization Modal

Tour the repo customizations to understand how context engineering works in practice.

**Steps:**

1. Open the Customization panel, Command: `Chat: Open Customizations (Preview)`
2. Browse the repo customizations — instructions, skills, and agents
3. Look at the **frontend design skill** and **Tailwind 4 instructions**

> 💡 **Think about:** What conventions or patterns from your own projects could become instructions or skills?

> 🔒 **Exclusion note:** The root `.copilotignore` contains supplemental patterns for environment files, private keys, and generated output on accounts where VS Code enables this feature. It deliberately does not exclude the workshop or source code, and it is not a security boundary. Organization-managed [content exclusion](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/context/content-exclusion) requires Copilot Business or Enterprise administration and currently does not cover IDE Edit/Agent modes or Copilot CLI.
